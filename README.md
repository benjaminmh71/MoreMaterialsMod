<h1>More Materials Mod</h1>
This mod adds three new types of pellet to the game: Roots/Tubers, Fruits, and Fungus. These act functionally like plant pellets. Each new pellet has a specific ideal diet value at which it has maximum efficiency: 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 respectively. The goal of this mod is to promote diversity among bibites by creating a more complex array of food sources, and to create a "pathway" for herbivores to easily transition into carnivores.

To Install:
<ul>
  <li>First, <a href=https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html>install Bepinex</a> on your copy of the Bibites version 0.6.0. Make sure you use <a href=https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.2>the latest stable build, v5.4.23.2</a>, not the pre-release or bleeding edge builds. Don't forget you need to run the game once to generate the Bepinex files.</li>
  <li>Then, download the files here by clicking download code near the top of the page.</li>
  <li>Then, put the downloaded .dll file in the Bepinex/Plugins file of The Bibites, and place the contents of the Mods folder into the The Bibites_Data/Mods folder of The Bibites.</li>
  <li>You can also install the starter bibite files found here by navigating to the location of the Bibites' saves on your computer once you've run with the mod installed, going to MoreMaterialsMod0.6.0Data, and placing them in the Bibites folder there. Note that this mod stores save files seperately from the regular game.</li>
</ul>
